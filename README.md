# Website creation project
Using valid, well-formed, semantic HyperText Markup Language (HTML), I style my soon to be webpages
with one valid, error-free, mobile-first Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) page. The web pages are then 
deployed to a public server, with a given domain. You can view the pages at http://martaemarshall.com
Enjoy!
