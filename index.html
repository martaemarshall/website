            <h2>Welcome</h2>
              <p>
                Welcome to THE martaemarshall.com! This is my first website, and I'm really nervous and excited about it at the 
                same time. Feel free to navigate through the site and see what I have made. My resume is attached to here, if
                you're so kind to give me a job. I created two page dedicated to Technological Advancements in Blacks,  or T.A.B,
                as well as a page dedicated to cool pictures that I have taken from cool places I've been too. I also decided to 
                be a tiny bit vain and include a slight bit of information about me, for a little personal connection. 
                You will get reasons why I made these with way more detail when you view them. With that, enjoy!

            <h2>Special Shoutouts</h2>
              <p>
                Even though I created this website, I did not learn it all on my own. I would love to give special acknowledgement
                to my ITM 361 class, instructed by Professor Karl Stolley, from the Illinois Institute of Technology. Spending hours
                upon hours coding and stressing trying to make every single thing work made this website what it is today. Oh, and my
                friends &amp; family. You guys are cool too!
