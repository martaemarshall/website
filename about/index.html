          <!-- Background Story About me -->
          <section class="background">
            <p>
              Born &amp; raised in Kansas City, Missouri, I've always been interested in technology, but I never knew what specifically
              and I didn't want to stay at home for college.
              So, in 2015, after graduating from Lincoln Prep high school, I knew that it was time to venture out and find out what I want to do with my life
              besides play video games &amp; watch Breaking Bad.
              This led me to attending the Illinois Institute of Technology in the Fall.
              Initially a Computer Science major, I did not feel that I as engaged as I should have been.
              I wanted something more interactive, more hands-on.
              So, I decided to switch to Information Technology &amp; Management w/ a minor in Psychology, 
              and I've never looked back since.
              I am studying now to become a professional Web Designer and/or Hardware specialist.
              I think I've finally found out what I wanted to do. YAY!
